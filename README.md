# EDA-on-Fifa-22-with-Lasso-Regression

![a](https://github.com/revyarly/EDA-on-Fifa-22-with-Lasso-Regression/blob/main/FIFA-22-cover.jpg)

Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the FIFA 22 dataset, utilizing Lasso Regression. EDA involves thorough data exploration and visualization, while Lasso Regression helps identify key variables, enhancing model accuracy for better predictions in FIFA 22 analytics.


## Dataset
I used a kaggle dataset for this project. 

The link to the dataset used is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-22-complete-player-dataset


## Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python

**Methods Used:** Machine Learning, Data pre-processing, Exploratory Data Analysis.


## Documentation

Here is the link to the [documentation](https://github.com/revyarly/EDA-on-Fifa-22-with-Lasso-Regression/blob/main/src_code_in_html.html)


## Repository Structure

 - `src_code`: contains the main code for the project
 - `src_code_in_html` : contains the indepth explanation of the processes and code in HTML format
 - `players_22`: contains the dataset that is used in the project
## Usage

To reproduce the predictions, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Run the `.ipynb` files to train the models and return the output
   

## Conclusion

One machine learning model is not fixed to one type of a problem. The selection of the model is user dependant and is based on what they are trying to achieve.

Learnings:

- Understood the importance of hyperparameter tuning in the model evaluation stage
- Understood the functioning of l1 regularization
- Gained some valuable insights from the data set using EDA

Improvements:

- More number of models with different complexities can be taken and experimented with.

Successfully predicted the overall rating of the outfield players using supervised learning method(using tunable hyperparameter), with good accuracy, and compared the results of the undertaken models
